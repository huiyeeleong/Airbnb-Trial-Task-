# Airbnb-Trial-Task-
This is a simple service to allow us to input ANY user’s Airbnb URL and the service returns a relative ranking of how that user’s profile ranks based initially on just how many reviews they have had.
For example, when https://www.airbnb.com.au/users/show/102308709 is input, the service determines she has 334 reviews and then returns something like https://www.airbnb.com.au/users/show/102308709 is in the top 80% of Melbourne Airbnb users based on number of reviews”.
